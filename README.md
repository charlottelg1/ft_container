# ft_container

Implement the following containers and turn in the necessary <container>.hpp files with a Makefile:
  
• vector - You don’t have to do the vector<bool> specialization.
  
• map
  
• stack - It will use your vector class as default underlying container. But it must still be compatible with other containers, the STL ones included.
  

You also have to implement:
  
• std::iterator_traits
  
• std::reverse_iterator
  
• std::enable_if- Yes, it is C++11 but you will be able to implement it in a C++98 manner. This is asked so you can discover SFINAE.
  
• std::is_integral
  
• std::equal and/or std::lexicographical_compare
  
• std::pair
  
• std::make_pair
